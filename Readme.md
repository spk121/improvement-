# Improvement

Between this insane job and my duties as a carer, this year is a lost cause. There is no possibility for anything other than responsibilities.
As such, I've fallen into the pattern of my downtime being just videogames and TV.

To keep myself hopeful, I've decided to start training for an adventure in six months' time. Whether I can actually go on an adventure seems doubtful, but it is the framing device for this challenge.

Let's pretend that in half a year I'm going on a Scuba trip.

for the next six months, I'm going to spend all my downtime prepping for a Scuba trip: working on my fitness, my swimming, my diving. Since I can't really get away from my responsibilities, there is no reason not to embrace my lack of freedom and use it to my advantage.

Instead of making gradual, sustainable changes to my lifestyle, like a sensible person, I'm going to change everything about myself in an insane, unrealistic way for the next half year. I'm going to be perfect.

to do this, I'm going to make a checklist and grade myself on my weekly completion of a set of nearly impossible goals.

I'm going to use the fact that I can't break my routine because of my responsibilities, and make it an inflexible super routine.

let's go. Six months of perfection from Mar 24 to Sept 24.
